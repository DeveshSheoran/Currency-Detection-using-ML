# Currency-Detection-using-ML

The main objective of this project is to identify the denomination of Indian currency using object identification.
We will create an Indian currency dataset of (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000) denomination.
We have used k-NN model in our object detection because of its greatest accuracy.
In our solution , we build the system for someone who needs to distinguish differnt currencies
